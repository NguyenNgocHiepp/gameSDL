# directions for use
You'll be a boy in the game. What you need to do is control your character to avoid the bats that are always chasing you. There will be an additional bat appear every ten seconds. It's impossible for you to kill the bat because you're only a boy. You can only reduce the number of bats on the screen by moving smartly so that the bats gather in the same place. The bats are stupid, all they know how to do is follow you so you can direct their flight. You jump to places where you can stand. There are 3 types of jumps, they are keys: UP, 2 and 3. If you collide one of the bats, the game is over. Since each object is an image frame, collision handling will sometimes fail. wish you sympathize.
